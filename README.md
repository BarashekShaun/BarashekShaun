# Hi there! 👋 I'm Alina — Backend Developer on a Mission 🚀

### About Me
I'm a backend enthusiast who enjoys diving deep into code and figuring out how things work under the hood. I started my journey with **Python**, learning frameworks like **Django** and **FastAPI**, and now I'm sharpening my skills in **C** and **C++** to understand low-level programming. My next goal is to master **Go** and build reliable backend systems.

- 🧰 **What I do**:
  - Create clean, maintainable code that solves real problems (or at least I’m working on it!).
  - Work with backend frameworks, databases, and server-side tools.
  - Collaborate effectively on team projects (because let’s be honest, chaos is way more fun when you’re doing it together!).
