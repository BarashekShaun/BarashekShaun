# Hi there! 👋 I'm Alina.

### About Me
I'm a backend enthusiast who enjoys diving deep into code and figuring out how things work under the hood.

- 🧰 **What I do**:
  - Create clean, maintainable code that solves real problems (or at least I’m working on it!).
  - Work with backend frameworks, databases, and server-side tools.
  - Collaborate effectively on team projects (because let’s be honest, chaos is way more fun when you’re doing it together!).
